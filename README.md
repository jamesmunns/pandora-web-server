# Pingora utils

This repository is meant to contain various crates which can be used to extend Pingora functionality. At the moment these are:

* [Static Files Module](../../tree/main/static-files-module): Serve static files from a directory

## Rust version

Currently, the minimal supported Rust version (MSRV) is 1.74. In future, the plan is to track [Pingoraâ€™s MSRV](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora/?tab=readme-ov-file#rust-version).
